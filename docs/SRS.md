## 1. Introduction

### 1.0 Preliminary
The folowing Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is based on a [template](https://github.com/nilskre/CommonPlayground/blob/pm/docs/SoftwareRequirementsSpecification.md) given from Ms Berkling.

### 1.1 Purpose
This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) describes all specifications for the application "Common Playground". It includes an overview about this project and its vision, detailed information about the planned features and boundary conditions of the development process.


### 1.2 Scope
The project is going to be realized as a web based Application.

Actors of this App can be users or administrators.

Planned Subsystems are:
* Game lobbies:  
  Lobbies are game session with players, users _(not logged in)_ and / or bots. The main purpose is to host a game session to be able to play rounds between many parties. They can be create by any User. The lobby should delete itself once no more human players are in the lobby.
* Account System:  
  Users can create / edit / delete their personal accounts and login / authenticate with them. They have to store data entries such as: Total wins - Friend list - and so on...
* Finding your Game:  
  To be able to quickly join a play
* Inviting others to a game:  
  Any player can create invite link to other people while waiting for the game to start. Other members can join via an invite, to which they don't necessary need an account. They can only join if the game hasnt started yet (or they were already in the lobby).
* Leaderboard:  
  The leaderboard shows a sorted accumulation of the top players, ranked from highest win-count down:
  * [1] Player43 (45 wins)
  * [2] UserWithaHat (39 wins)
  * [3] BotMaverick (38 wins)
* Storing Data:  
  User data for accounts has to be stored. The leaderboard, although also stored, will have to be recalculated each time.

### 1.5 Overview
The following chapter provides an overview of this project with vision and Overall Use Case Diagram. The third chapter (Requirements Specification) delivers more details about the specific requirements in terms of functionality, usability and design parameters. Finally there is a chapter with supporting information.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Vision
Inspired by carpool coordination services like ‘BlaBlaCar’ or ‘Mitfahrzentrale’ we want to build an application to coordinate game sessions. We plan to create a platform for people who are looking for other people to play games with. Covering online multiplayer games, tabletop, pen and paper or regular board games we want to provide a kind of bulletin board where people can state what they want to play, when and where they want to do it and how many people they are looking for. Others can then react to the postings and virtually join the play session to be connected by us so everyone can coordinate the actual play session together on a Common Playground.

## 3. Specific Requirements

### 3.1 Functionality
This section will explain the different use cases, you could see in the Use Case Diagram, and their functionality.  
Until December we plan to implement:
- 3.1.1 Posting a session
- 3.1.2 Getting an overview
- 3.1.3 Creating an account
- 3.1.4 Logging in
- 3.1.5 Logging out

Until June, we want to implement:
- 3.1.6 Joining a session
- 3.1.7 Keeping track of your sessions
- 3.1.8 Leaving a session
- 3.1.9 Finding a session
- 3.1.10 Getting in touch

#### 3.1.1 Posting a session
This feature is the essential one of our project. The user gets the possibility to post a session. Therefore, they have to select a game and also set the time when they want to play.For offline games, they have to set a location, too. For online games the location can be a server for example or simply be tagged as 'online'.

[Posting a session](./use_cases/UC1_Post_Session.md)

#### 3.1.2 Getting an overview
This feature provides a basic overview over all current sessions. All posted sessions are added here. From this overview you can select a session and from there join this session.

[Session overview](./use_cases/UC3_Session_Overview.md)

#### 3.1.3 Creating an account
To identify all useres we need an account system. This account system enables us to build important functions such as joining a session, leaving a session or a personalized overview over all sessions (Keeping track of your sessions).

[Create an account](./use_cases/UC4_Create_Account.md)

#### 3.1.4 Logging in
The app will provide the possibility to register and log in. This will also make the usability easier when a user wants to manage his sessions, post or join a session because they don't have to enter their mail address every time.

[Login](./use_cases/UC5_Login.md)

#### 3.1.5 Logging out
In case you share your phone, have multiple accounts or just want to be cautius about your privacy you should be able to manually log out.

[Logout](./use_cases/UC6_Logout.md)

#### 3.1.6 Joining a session
There is also the possibility to join an existing game session. Therefore, the user can select a specific session.

[Join a session](./use_cases/UC2_Join_Session.md)

#### 3.1.7 Keeping track of your sessions
The app provides the user with a seperate page view where they get an overview of all sessions they posted or joined. When the user clicks on a session, he can also see who joined his posted sessions.

[Keeping track of your sessions](./use_cases/UC7_Keeping_Track.md)

#### 3.1.8 Leaving a session
The user gets also the possibility to delete a session he posted or to leave a session he joined.

[Leaving a session](./use_cases/UC8_Leave_Session.md)

#### 3.1.9 Finding a session
Based on the overview over all sessions this features enables the user to find sessions by specific parameters. Therefore, the user can find a session by tags or other parameters like date. Later on, finding a session will be provided by geolocalization that the users can search for a session in a specific area.

[Finding a session](./use_cases/UC9_Find_Session.md)

#### 3.1.10 Getting in touch
There must be the possibility that two people who want to play together can communicate with each other. The player who joins the session gets the possibility to contact the owner and vice versa. Later on, when we will have implemented profiles, then they will form another way to communicate with each other.

[Getting in Touch](./use_cases/UC10_Getting_In_Touch.md)

#### 3.1.11 Presenting yourself and checking out others
With the possibility to log in there comes another functionality, the profile. Every user will have their own profile where they can write some informations about themselves. Because of the privacy policy in Europe, the user has the possibility to only write the information they want other people to see. Using the profile, users can also check out other players and learn e.g. their favorite games.

#### 3.1.12 Reporting users and managing friends
After a session, the app provides the users with the possibility to report the other participants. This is helpful because we want a community with fair players. Additionally, when they found an interesting person they can also add them to their friend list which also has a seperate page view.

#### 3.1.13 Banning users and deleting posts
There are also some functionalities for the admins. They will get the possibility to ban users and to delete any posts.

### 3.2 Usability
We plan on designing the user interface as intuitive and self-explanatory as possible to make the user feel as comfortable as possible using the app. Though an FAQ document will be available, it should not be necessary to use it.

#### 3.2.1 No training time needed
Our goal is that a user installs the android application, opens it and is able to use all features without any explanation or help.

#### 3.2.2 Familiar Feeling
We want to implement an app with familiar designs and functions. This way the user is able to interact in familiar ways with the app without having to get to know new interfaces.

### 3.3 Reliability

#### 3.3.1 Availability
The server shall be available 95% of the time. This also means we have to figure out the "rush hours" of our app because the downtime of the server is only tolerable when as few as possible players want to use the app.

#### 3.3.2 Defect Rate
Our goal is that we have no loss of any data. This is important so that the game sessions can carry on, even after a downtime of the server.

### 3.4 Perfomance

#### 3.4.1 Capacity
The system should be able to manage thousands of requests. Also it should be possible to register as many users as necessary.

#### 3.4.2 Storage
Smartphones don't provide much storage. Therefore we are aiming to keep the needed storage as small as possible.

#### 3.4.3 App perfomance / Response time
To provide the best App perfomance we aim to keep the response time as low as possible. This will make the user experience much better.

### 3.5 Supportability

#### 3.5.1 Coding Standards
We are going to write the code by using all of the most common clean code standards. For example we will name our variables and methods by their functionalities. This will keep the code easy to read by everyone and make further developement much easier.

#### 3.5.2 Testing Strategy
The application will have a high test coverage and all important functionalities and edge cases should be tested. Further mistakes in the implementation will be discovered instantly and it will be easy to locate the error.

### 3.6 Design Constraints
We are trying to provide a modern and easy to handle design for the UI aswell as for the architecture of our application. To achieve that the functionalities will be kept as modular as possible.

Because we are progamming an Android App we chose Java as our programming language. Also we are using the common MVC-architecture to keep the front end and back end seperated. For a clean front end structure we use MVVM.
To make the communication between the two parts easy, we will implement a RESTful-API between them which will provide the data in JSON-Format.
The supported Platforms will be:
- Android 4.4 and higher
- Java 8 and higher

### 3.7 On-line User Documentation and Help System Requirements
The usage of the app should be as intuitive as possible so it won't need any further documentation. If the user needs some help we will implement a "Help"-Button in the App which includes a FAQ and a formular to contact the developement team.

### 3.8 Purchased Components
We don't have any purchased components yet. If there will be purchased components in the future we will list them here.

### 3.9 Interfaces

#### 3.9.1 User Interfaces
The User interfaces that will be implented are:
- Dashboard - lists all session and makes it possible to filter sessions
- Session Page - shows detailed information about the session and makes it possible to connect session attendants for example via messaging system
- Login - this page is used to log in
- Register - provides a registration form
- Overwiew of personal sessions - shows all the sessions a user participates in
- Friend List - friends can be added
- Profile - makes it possible to post information about yourself, might provide messaging feature, also shows additional information about users (for example: Language, country, favorite games, etc.)
- Settings - shows the settings

#### 3.9.2 Hardware Interfaces
(n/a)

#### 3.9.3 Software Interfaces
The app will be runnable on Android 4.4 and higher. iOS won't be featured at the moment.

#### 3.9.4 Communication Interfaces
The server and hardware will communicate using the http protocol.

### 3.10 Licensing Requirements

### 3.11 Legal, Copyright, and Other Notices
The logo is licensed to the Common Playground Team and is only allowed to use for the application. We do not take responsibilty for any incorrect data or errors in the application.

### 3.12 Applicable Standards
The development will follow the common clean code standards and naming conventions. Also we will create a definition of d which will be added here as soon as its complete.
