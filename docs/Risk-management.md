Risk | Description | Probability of Occurrence (%) | Damage (0-10) | Mitigation Strategy | Person in Charge | Risk Factor (sorted)
---|---|---|---|---|---|---
Wrong<br />prioritization<br />of tasks | As a team there are new cool ideas all the time. That is great! But one also has to prioritize the use cases that were actually promised over those other ideas. | 70 | 8 🔴 | Use the “Priority” field for “Minor”, “Normal”, “Major”, “Critical” or “Show-stopper” value to signal which tasks should be processed first. | [<img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72347875?s=32&v=4" width="25" height="25"> Felix Gervasi](https://github.com/fgervasi-cell) | 560
False time estimation /<br />underestimating effort | Issues/Bugs/Tasks might be estimated with the wrong amount of time effort (most commonly too little time). This can lead to frustration and false planning. | 90 | 5 🟡 | Use YouTrack for project management/time planning and fill out the time estimation field for new issues. Use automated time tracking to later compare the estimated time with the actual time spent. Be honest with yourself 😉. | [<img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72347875?s=32&v=4" width="25" height="25"> Felix Gervasi](https://github.com/fgervasi-cell) | 450
Game is not fun<br />and too similar to “normal” Tetris | We have to make sure that people do not get bored with our game because it is the kind of Tetris they already know. | 50 | 7 🟠 | Get player feedback and organize a beta phase. | [<img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71791731?s=32&v=4" width="25" height="25"> Marc Gökce](https://github.com/MKrabs) | 350
Sickness | Especially due to the Corona pandemic the chances of a team member getting sick is quite high.  This would be a problem because it would delay the progress on open issues. | 60 | 4 🟡 | The team informs each other about the procedure in weekly meetings so that everyone has an idea about the current tasks and everyone can stand in for each other in case of emergency. | [<img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56353827?s=32&v=4" width="25" height="25"> Daniel Köck](https://github.com/Axolotl-D) | 240
Team members<br />not familiar with<br />new technology | At the beginning we chose to go with python (Django) as our main programming language. We made this decision knowing that we have little to no expertise in this language in order to learn it. This is of course a risk that we took! | 80 | 3 🟢 | Everybody on the team has to be committed to learn new technologies and needs to help each other if problems arise. | [<img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71791731?s=32&v=4" width="25" height="25"> Marc Gökce](https://github.com/MKrabs) | 240
User interface<br />not intuitive | If the user has to use a lot of clicks and navigate through a lot of windows to achieve a simple task or does not understand how to achieve a specific goal the user interface is probably bad. | 10 | 3 🟢 | Let people test our application. It is important here to not tell them how to use it so we can observe how they would behave in a “normal” environment. | [<img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56353827?s=32&v=4" width="25" height="25"> Daniel Köck](https://github.com/Axolotl-D) | 30
Team members leave | Maybe some team members will not pass the exams and fail or leave because of other reasons. | 2 | 10 🔴 | Pass exams and do not get demotivated 😉. | [<img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72347875?s=32&v=4" width="25" height="25"> Felix Gervasi](https://github.com/fgervasi-cell) | 20
